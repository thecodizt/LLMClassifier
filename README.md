# Enhancing Named Entity Recognition with Modified Language Model Architecture
#### Objective: The aim is to modify the LLM architecture to improve its performance on NER tasks and compare it with traditional methods.
## Methodology:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a dataset suitable for NER, such as the CoNLL-2003 dataset. Preprocess the data to handle any inconsistencies and prepare it for training.
2. LLM Modification for NER: Modify the LLM architecture to better handle NER tasks. This could involve adding an additional layer specifically designed for NER, such as a Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer, which can model the dependencies between tags in a sequence, which is crucial for NER tasks.
3. Training and Fine-tuning: Train the modified LLM on your dataset. Fine-tune the model parameters to optimize performance on the NER task.
4. Comparison with Traditional Methods: Compare the performance of your modified LLM with traditional methods for NER, such as CRF, SVMs or HMMs. Use appropriate evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Analysis: Analyze the results to understand where the modified LLM performs well and where it doesnâ€™t. Try to understand why these differences occur and how they could be addressed.
## Expected Outcomes: The research would lead to a novel application of LLM for NER tasks and provide a comprehensive comparison with traditional methods. This could potentially highlight the strengths and weaknesses of using LLMs for NER and pave the way for future research in this area.
